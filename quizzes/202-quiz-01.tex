\problem{}

Express the following binary number in decimal

$10110_2$

\vspace{2.5 cm}

\solution{\boxed{22_{10}}

I start by writing out the value assigned to each of the places.  From
left to right, they are

$$ 2^4, 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0 $$
$$ 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 $$

I then multiply each place by the value in that place

$$ 1 \cdot 16 + 0 \cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4
 + 1 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 1 = \boxed{22_{10}} $$

Calculate this expression and provide the answer in scientific notation.

$$ \frac{2.0 \cdot 10^{-6}}{1.4 \cdot 10^{-9}}$$

\solution{
$$1.4 \cdot 10^3$$
Our calculators show many more digits, but we since we only have two
digits specified in each, a good rule of thumb is to round to the first
two digits of the answer.
