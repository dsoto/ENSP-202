## Quiz

## Proportion
- Symbol $\propto$
- If two things are proportional, the values of the two properties are
  related by a constant factor

## Graph of proportionality
- Whiteboard

## Examples
- Pizza boxes and pizza slices
- Mass and volume of a material

<!--
more examples
-->

## Estimation
- For the purposes of estimation, we may treat certain things as
  proportional as an approximation.


## Proportion and shapes
- The shapes and areas we studied can be related to this proportion
  concept.


## Circle
- The circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius
- Is the area of a circle proportional to its radius?
- The size of the circle does not change this

<!--
no, it is proportional to the radius squared
sometimes we may say it is proportional, but not by the math definition
-->

## Trigonometry
- Trigonometry, as it applies to triangles, is the use of proportions
  with pretentious names like sine and tangent.
- The lengths of any two sides of a right triangle of a similar shape
  are proportional.
- We define "similar shape" by specifying the angles in the triangle
