## Due

## Reading


## Concentrations
- What are examples of concentrations you find interesting?

<!-- list some concentrations in environmental literature -->
<!-- - air concentrations of NOx SOx CO2 CH4 -->
<!-- - salinity haloclines -->

## pH scale
- Acids have low pH
- Bases have high pH
- This scale is logarithmic in base 10
- One pH is a factor of 10 of the concentration of hydrogen ions

## Concentration by weight
- Sugar in a can of soda
- Written

<!-- - what is the concentration by weight of sugar in soda 39gr/355ml -->

## Atmospheric concentrations
- Often expressed in ppm by volume

## Atmospheric CO2

## Changing concentrations
- If we have a toxin slowly escaping into the enviroment, how do we
  model its accumulation?

<!-- - how are concentrations changing over time? -->
<!-- - what if we are dripping pollution into a lake? -->
<!-- - can we express this as a concentration as a function of time? -->



<!-- rate of increase of carbon dioxide in atmosphere -->
<!-- - 132,000 TWh total energy consumption per year -->
<!-- - 132,000 10^12^ Wh 0.8 kg carbon / 10^3^ Wh -->
<!-- - 132 10^12^ kg carbon per year? -->
<!-- - off by a factor of four from skeptical science -->
