- Homework 2 Due Monday, 10 Feb 2014

## Due
- Read Guesstimation Chapter 2

## Persistence
- [TED talk on grit by Dr. Angela Duckworth](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ted-talks-education/speaker/dr-angela-lee-duckworth/)
- http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ted-talks-education/speaker/dr-angela-lee-duckworth/

## Homework 1
- Solution available on Moodle
- You are responsible for understanding solution

## Reading
- Guesstimation Chapter 2

<!--
## Reading
- review of exponents
- $x \cdot 10^y$
- Why is the y more important than the x?
- unnecessary precision is lying
-->

## Accuracy
- What things do we only know to one digit?
- What things do we only know to two digits?
- What things do we know to more than that?

## Accuracy
- Exponential notation lets us separate how big a number is and how well
  we know it
- $x \cdot 10^y$
- $y$ is how big
- Number of digits in $x$ is how well we know it

## Units
- What are some units and what do they describe?
- Length
- Mass
- Area
- Volume
- Time
- Dollars
- Gigabytes
- Clicks

## Combined units
- Speed is length per time
- Density is mass per volume
- Internet speed is megabits per second

## Units are fractions
- Units can be crossed out

## Unit conversion factors
- These factors are equivalent to one or unity.
- They are not numerically equal to one in most cases.

## Seconds per year
- Whiteboard

## Estimation as a skill
- Developing mathematical reasoning
- Precise vs Approximate reasoning

## Estimation
- How many pizzas to feed this room?
- How well do we know this estimate?

## Method
- How many people
- How much pizza per person

## Metta World Pizza
- How many pizzas to feed the world?
- How much dough do we need?

## Math
people times pizzas per person times dough per pizza

## Further similar estimates
- How many acres of wheat is that?
- How much cheese?
- How many cows is that?

## World scale estimations
The calculation to determine the dietary needs of all humans on the
planet isn't that far from this method of estimation.
