## Turn in homework

## Homework review
- Does anyone have a good way to think about going from decimal to
  binary?  (Sort of like a repeated subtraction.)
- Many of you were unable to proceed without breaking it down.  My goal
  is to teach you to break things down.

## Reading review
- Commuting
- Division and its discontents

## Reading discussion
<!--
who wants to summarize
anything new or interesting?
-->

## Why is multiplication useful?
- What are examples that use multiplication?

## Multiplication
- Relation to area
- Relation to volume
- Relation to rates

## Bean multiplication
- Desert island with only beans
- How do you perform a multiplication?

<!--
demonstrate repeated addition
demonstrate visual interpretation
demonstrate commutation
-->

## Commutation
$a \times b = b \times a$

$a \times b \times c = c \times b \times a = \ldots$

- for anything expressed by multiplication order does not matter

## How do we perform multiplication?
- In school?
- In real life?

<!--
what are methods of multiplication?
-->


## Computation
- By hand
- In our heads
- With a calculator
- With a computer
- Each tool has limitations

## Manual methods of multiplication
What algorithms did we learn to multiply numbers in school?
- Repeated addition
- By hand conventional method
- By hand lattice method

<!--
how does the place work with our multiplication?
-->



## Division
- Inverse of multiplication
- Repeated subtraction

## Division
$21 \div 5$

- How many fives in 21?
- How many in each box if I split 21 into 5 boxes?

<!--
this suggests two different algorithms for bean division
-->


## Why is division useful?
- What are examples that use division?
- How many beans in each box

<!--
finding how many you can provide of something given an amount
-->

## Bean division


## Manual methods of division
What algorithms did we learn to divide numbers on paper?
- Long division
- Partial quotients

## Combining multiplication and division
These rules need to be clear because we will be performing long chains
of multiplications and division to arrive at estimates.
