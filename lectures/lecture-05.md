- size of a proton (0.8768 fm, 0.8768 10^-15m)
- size of an atom (5.29 10^-11 m)
- size of a cell (10 10^-6 m)
- size of a beetle (1 10^-2 m)
- size of a human (1.5 m)
- size of a whale (3 10^1 m)
- giant redwood (1 10^2 m)
- size of the earth (12.7 10^6 m)
- size of the sun (1.39 10^9 m)
- distance to sun (1.5 10^11 m)
- size of the galaxy (9.46 10^20 m)
- size of the universe (8.8 10^26 m)

## Gigabytes vs Gibibytes
- Kibibyte = $2^10$ bytes = 1024 bytes
- Mebibyte = $2^20$ bytes = 1,048,576 bytes
- Gibibyte = $2^30$ bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes

## Division of exponential notation
- Multiplication by reciprocals
- Refers to written notes

## Exercises
- what is 2000 times 2000?
    - what is 2 times 2?
    - what is 3 + 3?
- what is 3 million times 4 billion
    - what is 3 times 4
    - what is 6 + 9?
- can you do these in your head?
- can we do these without a calculator?
- if we split a billion dollars among every american, how much money
  each?

<!--
first, can we perform these without pen and paper?
can we enter these on our calculators?
can we enter these on a computer?
-->

## Significant figures
- How well do we know a number?
- How accurately could I measure the length of this table?
- How accurately can you measure your height?
- Discussion
- gravitational constant 6.67384(80) x 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 sec^-2
- rydberg constant 1.097 373 156 8539(55) x 10^7 m^-1
- significant figures
- percent accuracy
