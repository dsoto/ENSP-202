## Due
- "All about e" and "Power Tools"

## Reading

## ENSP Announcement List
- Emails from Jo-Ann Smith

## Folding paper
- Zero folds 2$^0$ makes one sheet thick
- One fold 2$^1$ is two sheets thick
- How many times can you fold?
- How can we express the number of pages by the number of folds?
- Can we write out the pattern?

<!-- my max is six -->


## Rabbits
- start with two
- wait one year
- now we have double (4)
- wait another year
- now we have eight (8)
- how many in 5 years?

## Which gets bigger faster?

$x^2$ or $2^x$

## Money grows the same way
- Start with $1000
- Grow by 10%
- Now $1100
- Grow by 10%
- Now $1210

$$ 1000 \cdot (1+0.10)^{years} $$

## Continuous growth
- Previous examples were discrete
- The increase was at certain moments in time
- What if growth is continuous?
- This leads to the number $e$

## Examples of exponential growth
- Populations
- Disease spread
- Credit card balances

## Exponential decay
- Nuclear waste
- Toxins in a body



## Definitions of e

$$ e = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + 1/n)^n $$

$$ e = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2 \cdot 1} +  \frac{1}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}  +  \frac{1}{4 \cdot 3
\cdot 2 \cdot 1} + \cdots $$


## Properties of e

## The exponential function

$$ y = e^x $$

The slope of this function is equal to the function.

## Euler

$$ e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta $$

$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0 $$

where $i = \sqrt{-1}$


## When does proportion and linearity stop being useful?
- What is linear?
- What is not linear?
