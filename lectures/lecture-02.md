did students get reading email?
just made moodle available

<!--
start with overview of course
-->

## Due Today
- Read Fish to Infinity
- Read Rock Groups

## Today's Topic
- Course Overview
- Numerical representation

## Course Overview

- Precision and accuracy of estimates
- Estimation
- Geometry, Trigonometry
- Exponential functions
- Graphs
- Calculus
- Statistics
- Forecasting

## Numerical Representation
<!--
This is a deep topic
what is the difference between a number and its name
-->

<!--
numbers have behaviors and properties that are independent of the
names we give them or the ways we represent them.
-->

## Discussion
<!--
activities
- what was the main idea of fish?
- what was the main idea of rock groups?
-->

<!--
- start with a demonstration of the properties of numbers
- later move to the representation
-->

<!--
pass out 20 beans and one die each
what shapes can we make with our beans
start with one bean
two beans, line only
three beans triangle, line
four beans square, line
five beans line only, star?
six beans, rect, triangle, line
for each number write properties on the board
-->

## Number shapes
- How many patterns can you arrange your beans in?

## Patterns
- Triangular numbers
- Square numbers
- Even numbers
- Prime numbers
- Cube numbers
- Note that these patterns are independent of the name

## Representation
- How is a representation different than the thing it represents?
- What are the different ways we represent numbers?

## How do we name these numbers
- One through nine beans
- What happens with 10 beans
- How many symbols do we have?

## Common representations
- Arabic numerals
- Dice and dominoes
- Braille
- Words


## How does a computer represent a number?
- Binary (base 2)
- Octal (base 8)
- Hexadecimal (base 16)


## Where is this going?
- We can now represent beans
- How about pieces of beans?
- How about millions of beans?
- How about water?  What about things we can't count?


## Motivation
- How do we easily talk about quantities?
- Large quantities?
- Small quantities?

## Arabic representation
- Powers of 10 in each place
- Draw on the board


<!--
babylonians - 3100 B.C.
base 60

Mayans had a zero around 350 AD

arabic numerals

invention of the zero

## Different bases
- 10$_{10}$
- 1010$_{2}$

## Reading for next time
- Strogatz, Location, location, location
