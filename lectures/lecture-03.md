admin
- give syllabus to student who didn't attend first day
- it should be mandatory to ask a question you are convinced is silly
- please ask questions, i know this material very well.  what i don't know
is the sorts of problems you are going to have learning it.  your
questions help me figure that out.
- what is this adding square stuff from schools?
- how often do you check moodle?

## Reading Due Today
- Strogatz, Location, location, location

<!--
questions from reading?
main point of reading?
-->

## Location system
- Decimal
- Extend to binary

<!--
refer to written notes
-->

<!--
Note that our language gives a hint to the decimal location system
- how is the way we say numbers similar?
-->

## Activity
- Break into groups
- How would you represent a number with beans
    - Solicit general ideas after 5 minutes
    - Group exercise to represent a number
- How would you represent a number with dice
    - Solicit general ideas
    - Group exercise to represent a number

## Drill
- Convert 10101 base 2 to decimal (16 + 4 + 1 = 21)
- Convert 1A base 16 to decimal (16 + 10 = 26)
- Convert 13 to binary (1101 base 2)
- Convert 66 to hexadecimal (42 base 16)

## Introduction to Scientific Notation
- Scientific Notation
- Engineering Notation

## Negative numbers
- Natural extension of subtraction

<!--
what are examples of things represented by negative numbers?
- debt
- latitude?
- time zone
- temperature
-->

## Decimals
- Negative powers
- Demonstrate locations of digits on other side of the decimal

<!--
what are common things represented by decimals
- money, cents, pennies
-->

## Fractions
- Slices of pizza are a good model

Note that not all fractions can be easily represented in our base 10
decimal system.
