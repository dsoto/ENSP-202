## Review
- Questions from Homework 1?
- Units

## Student density
- Students per acre
- Number per area
- [Cal State densities](https://twitter.com/calpolypomona/status/431937140457349120/photo/1)
- Spans two orders of magnitude

## Two units in the denominator
- Births per capita per year

<!--
births per year
births per capita
neither exactly captures the full picture
-->

## Estimations

## Method
- Define question
- Break into smaller pieces
- List out necessary quantities
- Create and explain estimates
- Inspect for plausibility or contradictions


## Estimations
- How much water is used in the dorms?
- how much world pizza?


## Exercises
- guesstimations
- perform in groups of three, share answers with class

## Crusts
- From last week's pizza party for the world, if no one eats the crusts,
  and we line them end to end, how far will they reach?

<!--
What is length of crusts for pizza to feed world
number of people: 7 billion
slices per person: 2
slices per pizza: 8
length of crust per pizza: pi * circumference
