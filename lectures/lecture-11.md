## Due
- Readings
    - Working your quads
    - Square dancing

## Moodle
- Slides posted
- Written materials posted
- Please ask if you do not see materials there

## Project
- Description available on Moodle
- I'll announce deadlines as we go

## Square roots
- 90 seconds of research says that calculators use an iterative method
  to calculate square roots

## Quadratic theorem
- Blends algebra and areas

$$ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$

## Completing the square

<!--
this relationship between formulas and areas is what i find interesting
-->

## Pythagorean theorem

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

- We usually interpret as a relation between the sides of a right
  triangle
- We can also interpret as a statement about the areas

## Measure
- What is the area of a car?
- How many cars in the lot?
- What is the density of cars (cars per unit area)?
- What fraction of the lot is filled by cars?

## Verify
- Compare to google earth
