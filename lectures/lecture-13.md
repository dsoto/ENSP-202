## Due


## Reading
- Sine qua non, Strogatz
- Sine and cosine goes beyond triangles


## Examples of sine waves
- We only use one quarter of the sine wave
- Synthesizers add sine waves together to make sounds
- Sound is made up of sine waves
- Light is made up of sine waves
- Populations have actions similar to sine waves

## Show how we plot a sine wave
- Written
- We generalize the triangle to a circle to define sine for angles above
  90 degrees

## Different measurements of angle
- Rotations
- Degrees
- Radians


## Rotations
- Divers use full rotations as a unit of angle
- Isn't easy to express small angles

## Degrees
- Divide the circle into 360 parts


## Radians
- Divide the arc length of a wedge by the radius
- Radians have no dimension
- The most beautiful and natural way to describe angles


## Degree and radian conversion factors
- How many degrees in a circle?
- How many radians in a circle?
- Form a conversion factor

## How many radians in a thumb?
- Written
- For small angles, we can estimate the arc length as the vertical
  length
- This means in radians for small angles
$$\sin\theta \sim \theta$$

## Calculator exercises
- Sine and cosine functions
    - Find the sine of 30 degrees
    - Find the cosine of 60 degrees
- Switching between degrees and radians
    - Find the cosine of 1 radian
    - Find the sine of 1/2 a radian

## Mathematically expressing a sine wave

$$ \sin\theta $$

$$ \sin \omega t $$

We can think of this as another unit conversion.  In this case instead
of converting degrees to radians, we are converting meters or seconds or
days to radians.  We can think of the greek letter $\omega$ as a
conversion factor.
