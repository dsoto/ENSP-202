## Project questions

## Due

<!-- cover stereotype threat research in class? -->
<!-- find video with findings? -->

<!-- drought plots and stuffs -->
<!-- great examples on probabilities and slopes -->

## Readings

## Change we can believe in
- Rates of change
- Finding optima (maximums and minimums)

## Take it to the limit
- Breaking something into infinitely small pieces can lead to an
  otherwise impossible solution
- Area of the circle is an example

<!--
many thought the circle was the main idea
infinitely small limits were the main idea
-->

<!--
- the limit was the main idea
- the circle was the example
- breaking into smaller pieces
- can go to infinity
- can go to very small
- very small is how we do computer calculations on many things, weather,
  climate change, etc...
-->


## Rates of change
- Calculus gives us tools to find the "slope" or rate of change of any
  function

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} $$

- This symbol for the derivative is the same as our more familiar rise
  over run, but for any function $y(x)$.

<!--
what is the slope of a linear function?
what is the slope of a sinusoidal function?
what is the slope of an exponential function?
-->

## Odometer example
- Written

## Finding the maximum or minimum
- You have 100 meters of fencing and want to create the largest
  rectangular garden possible.  How long should the sides be?
- We create a function for the area and look at its slope.
