## Introduction
- My background, my interests
- Physics and engineering is the application of mathematics to the world
- liked math, good talent but there are much better
- Honors math first day at Stanford
- Unprepared, no way to get big picture skills

## Icebreaker
- name, year, major
- what do you like most about math?
- what do you like least about math?
- what do you hope to get out of this class?
- what is your biggest fear in this class?
- go around the room and introduce your neighbor

<!--
- show of hands, how comfortable are you with mathematics?
- how comfortable are you with physics?
- algebra?
- calculus?
-->


## Syllabus
- show online copy?
- course description
- we will return to learning objectives so we'll skip over them
- requirements
- grading
- agreements
- texts
- tentative lecture schedule
- readings
- office hours
- university policies


## Learning objectives
- increase confidence
- model thinking, estimations
- quantitative critical thinking

## Increase Confidence

## Precise answers vs plausible estimations
- until this point you have been asked for precise answers
- In this class we will create plausible estimates
- We will also focus on communicating our estimation methods

## Model thinking
- A model is an approximation that allows us to think about the world
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- How do we separate facts from opinions?

<!--
- who can name an example of a model?
- who can think of a place where models are useful?
- who knows who nate silver is?
-->


## Quantitative Estimation Skills
- You will leave this class with the ability to quantitatively evaluate
  new ideas for feasibility
- We will develop analytical tools and techniques for energy estimation


## Objectives
- Convey the beauty of mathematics
- Paul Lockhart thinks the usefulness of mathematics is unnecessary
- I will take a different tack
- I will wonder why there are so many connections between the
  mathematical and the physical
- Convey the usefulness of mathematics
- building intuition

## Painting metaphor
- Paint by numbers
- mathematicians paint portraits and art
- we will paint houses

## Connections
- Connections between different fields of mathematics
- Connections between mathematics and the physical world
- Leibnitz formula for pi
- Dirac formula and the positron

## Why is this important?

## West virginia water contamination

## Examples of things using mathematics
- polls of current opinion
- contamination
- climate change
- finances

## Organization
- date book
- email forwarding
- write down that we will have a reading due by wednesday

## Critical thinking skills
- How do you gain information about a topic?
- How do evaluate the quality of that information?
- How do you assess the quality of an argument?
