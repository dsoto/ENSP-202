## Exercises

## Logarithm
- Inverse of exponential function
- If $y = 10^x$ then $\log y = x$
- If $y = e^x$ then $\ln y = x$
- For any other number (called the base, $b$):
    - If $y = b^x$ then $\log_b y = x$

## Logarithm
The logarithm in base 10 basically asks, if you are in base 10, how many digits?

## Logarithmic scales
- Musical pitch
- Richter scale
- Vision
- Sound

In each of these, we perceive or use the logarithm.

## Unexpected connections
The natural logarithm is the area under the 1/x curve

## This rule is a consequence of logarithms
$$ 10^a \cdot 10^b = 10^{a+b} $$

Take log of both sides

$$ a \cdot \log 10 + b \cdot \log 10 = (a+b) \cdot \log 10 $$

## Calculators
- Compute the base 10 log of 250
- Compute the base e log of 250
