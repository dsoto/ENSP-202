## Due

## Review
- Pizza estimation

## Estimation method
- Define question
- Draw a diagram if useful
- Break into smaller pieces
- List out necessary quantities
- Make and explain estimates
- Carry out calculation
- Inspect for plausibility or contradictions

## Crusts
- From last week's pizza party for the world, if no one eats the crusts,
  and we line them end to end, how far will they reach?

<!--
Define question: What is length of crusts for pizza to feed world

Smaller pieces, list out quantities
number of people: 7 billion
slices per person: 2
slices per pizza: 8
length of crust per pizza: pi * circumference
length of crust per slice:

Make estimates

Carry out calculation

Inspect for plausibility

## Showers
- We are in a severe drought and will be asked to conserve water soon
- Estimate the water use in the dorms from bathing and showers each day

<!--
what is the volume of water used in the dorms for showering
number of students in dorms:
showers per student per day:
time per shower:
water per time:
