What level of investment is required to bring electricity to the world
population without it?

# Proposal

The goal of this estimation project is to obtain an estimate of the
amount of funding needed to supply electricity to the persons still
lacking it.

The simplest estimation has the following quantities

- Population lacking electricity
- Cost per person to electrify

The World Bank and other agencies have good estimates of the
unelectrified population, about 1.3 billion people have no access to
electricity.

The cost per person is a bit more difficult, and I'd like to do some
more in depth work here.  The cost per person can vary depending on
where they live and what sources of energy are available and how much
energy they will consume.

- How many can be served most economically by extending the existing grid and adding
  conventional generation (coal, natural gas, hydroelectricity, and
  nuclear)
- How many can be served most economically by distributed renewable
  energy such as solar with battery storage?
- What are the costs of each of these?

To answer the first and second, I will get the numbers for the
unelectrified in terms of whether they are in urban and rural areas and
will assume that urban customers will be served best by grid extension
and rural customers by distributed, renewable sources.

Then based on the energy demanded by each and the cost of that energy
for traditional and distributed sources, I'll gain my estimate.
