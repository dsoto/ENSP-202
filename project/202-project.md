# ENSP 202 Final Project

You will come up with your own estimation problem for a topic that you are
interested in.  A good estimation problem will be relevant to you.
Think about things that you now have the tools to figure out that you
might like to know.  It could be about time to graduation, pollution in
the area, the cost of gasoline, or anything we can address with numbers.
The most important requirement is that you stretch beyond your comfort
level.

The final assignment will contain

- The problem statement
- The estimations you made
- The calculation you made
- The implications of the result

This assignment is structured to simulate the way that this work is most
often done in professional settings.  That means we will create a
proposal and get feedback.  We will also turn in a first draft of our
estimate and get feedback before turning in the final draft.

This feedback is important, in your careers, you will have to
constructively comment on the work of others.  This project will give
you practice doing this.

Lastly, we will present our work to each other in brief (5 minute)
presentations in class.

## Brainstorm topics
<!--Due 17 Feb 2014-->

Turn in a list of three possible project topics.

## Choose topic
<!--Due 24 Feb 2014-->

From your list of topics, narrow it down to one topic.

## Estimation Proposal
<!--Due 10 Mar 2014-->

With your chosen topic in mind, come up with a quantitative question you
want to provide estimates for.  Clearly state both the question and an
outline of how you plan to estimate it.

## Proposal Feedback

You will receive two estimation proposals from your classmates.
You will read them and give you feedback on the following aspects of the
proposals.

### The clarity of the proposal

How could the proposal be written to make it more clear?

### Organization of the proposal

Is it well organized?  Does it have a structure that aids the reader in
understanding the goals and methods?

### The usefulness of the method proposed

Apply the mathematical intuition you have gained so far in the class.
Will the estimations proposed answer the question posed?  Are there
improvements that could be made to the method?

Make your feedback supportive, constructive and keep it focused on the
proposal.  As a rule of thumb, provide comments only on the work, not
the person.  Your goal is to help your classmates improve the quality of
their projects and reach their highest potential.

### Submission

Communicate your written feedback to your classmates however you like.
You will also submit a copy of your written feedback to your classmates, in
PDF format, on Moodle.  Indicate the name of the feedback recipients in
the comments.

## Estimation first draft
<!--Due 7 Apr 2014-->

Based on the feedback and your original proposal, you will turn in your
calculation and an explanation of your methods and the implications of
your result.

This report will contain a written part with an introduction, a
description of your methods, a summary of your results, and a discussion
of the implications of your result.  You will also include either in the
text or as an appendix, the details of your calculations.

Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are late.

## First Draft Feedback
<!--Due 14 Apr 2014-->

Your first draft will be randomly assigned to two other students
in the class.  They will read it and give you feedback on

- Is the report well structured and does it contain an introduction,
  method description, and discussion of implications?
- Can you follow the calculation?
- Is the method clear?
- Are there any mistakes in the calculation?

If you don't have any suggestions for improvement, point out which aspects of
the project are strongest and why.


### Submission

You will have the same feedback partners as you had for the proposal.
Communicate your written feedback to your classmates however you like.
You will also submit a copy of your written feedback to your classmates, in
PDF format, on Moodle.  Indicate the name of the feedback recipients in
the comments.

## Final submission

<!--Due 21 Apr 2014-->

Incorporate the feedback you received and write a final submission of
your calculation and the explanation.

Unexcused late submissions will lose 10 points for each day they are late.

Your projects will be graded according to the following criteria

- Clarity of writing
- Clarity and communication of your quantitative analysis
- Accuracy of the quantitative analysis
- Organization of report

### Submission

You will submit a single PDF file with the report and sufficient details
to understand your calculations.  If you also wish to turn in any
supplementary materials, you may submit those files on Moodle as well.

## Final presentation

<!-- Due ??? -->

You will provide a brief presentation of your calculation during class
on your estimation.  You will sign up for 10 minute slots with an online
link that I will provide.  You may use whatever presentation tools you
like.  Prepare about 5 minutes of material to leave time for questions.

Email me your presentation file in either Powerpoint, Keynote, or PDF
before class the day of your presentation.  I will run the presentations
from my laptop.

### Submission

Please create a PDF file of your presentation and upload it to Moodle.

## Final presentation feedback

During class you will be providing feedback on the presentations.

You are also expected to participate by asking questions.  I will pass
out two cards to each student.  Write your names on them.  When you ask
a question, pass your card to the front.  To get full participation
credit, you'll need to turn in both cards by the end of the semester.

You will also give feedback to the presenters on their content and
delivery.  These comments are to be constructive and polite with the
objective of helping students improve their presentation skills.  I will
create a shared document for us to add feedback.

When providing feedback on the content and delivery of the talk, keep
the following questions in mind.

### Content

- Does the presentation have a structure that is clear?
- Is the main point of the speaker clearly communicated?
- Are the assumptions and sources of estimations clear?

### Delivery

- Does the presentation appear well prepared?
- Is the presenter engaged with the audience?
