## Course Description
Lectures and workshop designed to enhance students' confidence in
analytical problem solving. Essential techniques emphasizing
environmental applications: translating knowledge into abstract and
mathematical models, numerical estimates, basic geometry and
trigonometry, dimensional analysis, unit conversions, interpreting
statistical data, and graphic display of information. Conceptual
introduction to calculus, differential equations, and complex numbers.
Prerequisites: ENSP majors or minors; completion or concurrent
enrollment in GE Area B4 (Math Concepts). Cr/NC only.


## Learning Objectives

- Increase confidence in the use of mathematics
- Development of model thinking and quantitative estimation skills
- Development of quantitative critical thinking skills


## Course Requirements

This course will have both in-class exercises and homework to reinforce
concepts learned in class.  Readings will be assigned and quizzes will
be given on these readings.  Students should be prepared to discuss any
assigned reading in class.  Students will complete a final project that
uses mathematics and estimation skills to estimate the answer a current
question of importance in the media, politics, or environment.


## Grading

This class is graded on a credit/no credit basis.  Any student who makes
an observable effort to complete every question of every assignment will
receive credit.

- Classwork and quizzes 25%
- Homework 25%
- Project 25%
- Final 25%


## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and
interactions.  In general, I expect students to be supportive of each
others learning goals.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  Using devices for social networks or other
uses during class time is strongly discouraged.


## Required Texts

- *The Joy of x: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity*, Steven Strogatz.
- *Guesstimation*, Lawrence Weinstein and John A. Adam

There will also be readings posted to Moodle throughout the
semester.


## Lectures

The tentative schedule of lecture topics for the class is below.  This
schedule is likely to change.
