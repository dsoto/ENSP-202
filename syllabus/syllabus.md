## Course Description
Lectures and workshop designed to enhance students' confidence in
analytical problem solving. Essential techniques emphasizing
environmental applications: translating knowledge into abstract and
mathematical models, numerical estimates, basic geometry and
trigonometry, dimensional analysis, unit conversions, interpreting
statistical data, and graphic display of information. Conceptual
introduction to calculus, differential equations, and complex numbers.
Prerequisites: ENSP majors or minors; completion or concurrent
enrollment in GE Area B4 (Math Concepts). Cr/NC only.

## Learning Objectives

- Increase confidence in the use of mathematics
- Development of model thinking and quantitative estimation skills
- Development of quantitative critical thinking skills

## Course Requirements

This course will have both in-class exercises and homework to reinforce
concepts learned in class.  Readings will be assigned and quizzes will
be given on these readings.  Students should be prepared to discuss any
assigned reading in class.

## Grading

This class is graded on a credit/no credit basis.  Any student who makes
an observable effort to complete every question of every assignment will
receive credit.

## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and interactions.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  Using devices for social networks or other
uses during class time is strongly discouraged.

## Required Texts

There is no required text for this class.  There will be readings posted
to Moodle throughout the semester.
